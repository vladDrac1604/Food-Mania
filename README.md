A recipe-book website I made using angular and node.js. Here users can post dishes they make and others can view these posts, add a like & leave a review on them as well. It uses angular's UI responsiveness features like client-side pagination, 2 way data binding, single page component re-rerendering and much more. Advance features like mailing, photo upload, password resetting via mail, data hashing while storing in database are also implemented in the app.
